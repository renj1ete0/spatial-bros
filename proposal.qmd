# Theme: Point Pattern Analysis

# Abstract

The **Spatial Bros** is created to assist non-technical savvy users in performing geographical point pattern analysis. Our application will assist users with 2 kinds of analysis as shown:

Spatial Points Analysis

-   Network Constraint Spatial Point (Network KDE)

-   1st and 2nd Order Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

For each of the analyses, the application will provide users with kernel density maps, 1st and 2nd order will provide and perform types of hypothesis testing to allow users to generate insights towards statistical conclusions on the distribution of spatial points along networks.

# Problems & Motivation

In today's technological advancing world, there are many interesting spatial data sources that exist in the forms of Geospatial and Aspatial format. Geospatial data is the foundation based on the foundation of geographical boundary locations and Aspatial data are the observations recorded that can be used to generate derive insights.

Despite that, there are not many people who are knowledgeable and trained to perform such analysis. Without the fundamental knowledge and appropriate training, any results based on the analysis performed could be inaccurate.

Hence, our group's main focus is to perform our analysis and develop a web-based geospatial tool using R Shiny with regards to Point Pattern Analysis particularly on Network-Constrained Point Pattern Analysis (NCPPA) and 1st/2nd Order Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). We hope this application can empower and educate users and conduct the analysis they want regardless of their technical expertise to gain further insights from geospatial data. 

# Project Objectives

Throughout the development of this project, our group would like to perform our analysis and develop an analytical application that allow users to:\

-   Better understand the capabilities of Network-Constrained Point Pattern Analysis

-   Better understanding of 1st and 2nd order Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

-   Conduct Network-Constrained Point Pattern Analysis density estimation (NetKDE) and (G, K) function analysis

-   Ability to generate insights based on the above analysis for any decision making

# Our Approach & Methodology

## Data Preparation

-   To source and assemble data from various sources out there

-   Importing the Spatial Data (Geospatial)

-   Data Wrangling 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

-   Visualise and examine the distribution of spatial pointers

-   Examine any anomalies and outliers in the dataset sourced

-   Further Data Wrangling (where necessary)

## Network Constrained Point Pattern Analysis

-   Network Kernel Density Estimation - To explore the intensity of points along network

-   G and K function - To identify any potential clustering patterns, random distributions, even or uneven distributions of patterns

## 1st & 2nd Order Kernel Density Estimation

-   1st order Kernel Density Estimation

-   G and K function

<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2015.1080829>

### Summary

Network KDE and Network K-function was used to study retail service  hot-spot areas and spatial clustering patterns of a local retail giant, Suguo, in Nanjing City.

### Learning Points and Linking Back to Our Project

The bandwidth for generating network-constrained kernel density estimation (KDE) maps would produce representations of distributions that  and we should explore various network KDE bandwidths to find suitable bandwidth and also provide options for users to adjust bandwidth

### Summary

The team created a tool to analyse the ease and equity of access to major POI using public transit in US cities using an interactive website (to filter selected POIs) calculated with 2SFCA (2-step floating catchment area) approach.\
\
It aims to explore effectiveness and equity of public transit system in major US cities

## Using hexagonal grids and network analysis for spatial accessibility assessment in urban environments -- a case study of public amenities in Toruń

<http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/mgrsd-2018-0037>

### Summary

The paper looks at a methodology to analyse spatial accessibility using network analysis and a hexagonal grid to the city of Toruń, Poland. The paper also explored that it is important to empower citizens with knowledge of the geospatial analysis and created a web application to empower citizens with knowledge.

### Learning Points and Linking Back to Our Project

-   Adopt a similar methodology of converting distance for OD Matrix, specifically Origin and Destination distances to travel times by assuming a walking speed of 4km/h

-   Network will be calculated using the travel time of the appropriate speed (eg. road will be calculated based on road speed limit)

-   This will prevent underestimation of travel times which may affect the accessbility metrics

With the inclusion of three different Network datasets in Melbourne and various Spatial Points datasets, we hope to allow users to understand and gain further insight of the use cases of Network-Constrained Spatial Points Analysis and 1st/2nd Order KDE along different networks such as Pedestrian, Roads and Tram Networks.

For example, users could select health services and understand more about geographical accessibility of health services across Melbourne by Road. 

They could also select and see accessibility of drinking fountains by pedestrian paths, which could drive further understanding about the distribution of drinking fountains across the city and possibly push for more water fountains to reduce the use of disposable water bottles to be more sustainable.
