# Theme: Point Pattern Analysis

# Abstract

The **Spatial Bros** is created to assist non-technical savvy users in performing geographical point pattern analysis. Our application will assist users with 2 kinds of analysis as shown:

Spatial Points Analysis

-   Network Constraint Spatial Point (Network KDE)

-   1st and 2nd Order Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

For each of the analyses, the application will provide users with kernel density maps, 1st and 2nd order will provide and perform types of hypothesis testing to allow users to generate insights towards statistical conclusions on the distribution of spatial points along networks.

# Problems & Motivation

In today's technological advancing world, there are many interesting spatial data sources that exist in the forms of Geospatial and Aspatial format. Geospatial data is the foundation based on the foundation of geographical boundary locations and Aspatial data are the observations recorded that can be used to generate derive insights.

The City of Melbourne has many datasets that are readily available to the public, through [City of Melbourne Open Data](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/pages/home/) and [Data Vic](https://www.data.vic.gov.au/). Yet, this only fufills the first part of 'data access' by providing datasets on their websites available for download and simple spatial points exploration using the interactive map provided.

Users who are not trained in geospatial analysis or GIS are unable to perform their own analysis to understand spatial pattern or trends behind their neighbourhood which could help citizens or outsiders to understand the city better and possibly formulate citizen efforts.

These are important pointers as the true democratisation of data should allow users to be empowered with tools to comfortably analyse datasets with ease and come up with their analysis and conclusions.

Hence, our group's main focus is to perform our analysis and develop a web-based geospatial tool using R Shiny with regards to Point Pattern Analysis particularly on Network-Constrained Point Pattern Analysis (NCPPA) and 1st/2nd Order Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). We hope this application can empower and educate users and conduct the analysis they want regardless of their technical expertise to gain further insights from geospatial data. 

# Project Objectives

Throughout the development of this project, our group would like to perform our analysis and develop an analytical application that allow users to:\

-   Better understand the capabilities of Network-Constrained Point Pattern Analysis

-   Better understanding of 1st Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), Clarks and Evans Test and 2nd Order (G,K) function analysis

-   Conduct Network-Constrained Point Pattern Analysis density estimation (NetKDE) and (G, K) function analysis

-   Ability to generate insights based on the above analysis for any decision making

# Our Approach & Methodology

## Data Preparation

-   To source and assemble data from various sources out there

-   Importing the Spatial Data (Geospatial)

-   Data Wrangling 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

-   Visualise and examine the distribution of spatial pointers

-   Examine any anomalies and outliers in the dataset sourced

-   Further Data Wrangling (where necessary)

## Network Constrained Point Pattern Analysis

-   Network Kernel Density Estimation - To explore the intensity of points along network

-   G and K function - To identify any potential clustering patterns, random distributions, even or uneven distributions of patterns

## 1st & 2nd Order Kernel Density Estimation

-   1st order Kernel Density Estimation

-   Clarks Evans Test

-   2nd Order G and K function analysis

## User Interface and Design

-   Allow users to use the Interactive Shiny App easily, even without the user guide

-   Instructions on interpretation of results will be provided on each individual KDE or statistical analysis page to allow users to understand results and formulate their conclusions

-   Explanations of what each function and method that users are allowed to select for them to understand how each function/method works

## Network-constrained and category-based point pattern analysis for Suguo retail stores in Nanjing, China

<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2015.1080829>

### Summary

Network KDE and Network K-function was used to study retail service  hot-spot areas and spatial clustering patterns of a local retail giant, Suguo, in Nanjing City.

### Learning Points and Linking Back to Our Project

The bandwidth for generating network-constrained kernel density estimation (KDE) maps would produce representations of distributions that  and we should explore various network KDE bandwidths to find suitable bandwidth and also provide options for users to adjust bandwidth

## **Identifying factors of influence in the spatial distribution of domestic fires**

<https://doi.org/10.1080/13658810903143634>

### Summary

To gain an understanding of how domestic fires arise based on different factors such as time of day, building types and income groups.\

### Learning Points and Linking Back to Our Project

The use of the Strauss process for inferring different variables such as building types, income groups is an interesting way to generate random patterns of points where it stimulates the realization of the Strauss process. Developed by Strauss, Kelly and Ripley, it is a model for spatial inhibition that ranges from a strong 'hard core' inhibition to a completely random pattern according to gamma and beta value. The results also show that there are significant differences in factors that influence the spatial distribution of fires with the above variables listed.

With the inclusion of three different Network datasets in Melbourne and various Spatial Points datasets, we hope to allow users to understand and gain further insight of the use cases of Network-Constrained Spatial Points Analysis and 1st/2nd Order KDE along different networks such as Pedestrian, Roads and Tram Networks.

For example, users could select health services and understand more about geographical accessibility of health services across Melbourne by Road. 

They could also select and see accessibility of drinking fountains by pedestrian paths, which could drive further understanding about the distribution of drinking fountains across the city and possibly push for more water fountains to reduce the use of disposable water bottles to be more sustainable.
