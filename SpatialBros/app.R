For each of the analyses, the application will provide users with statistical functions, kernel density heat map estimation, various mappings and G&K function results. The application will cover an array of spatial points located in Melbourne City such as childcare centres, business establishments, 
                             famous landmarks including places of interest such as schools, theaters, health service, sports facilities, drinking fountains and public toilets. The spatial points will work in conjunction to cover areas of the cityâ€™s road, pedestrian and tram network. From this application,
