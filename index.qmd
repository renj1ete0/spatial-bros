## About the Project

The Spatial Bros is created to assist non-technical savvy users in performing geographical point pattern analysis. Our application will assist users with 2 kinds of analysis as shown:

Spatial Points Analysis

-   Network Constrained Spatial Point

    -   Network Constrained Kernel Density Map

    -   Network Constrained G/K Statistical Functions

-   1st/2nd Order Spatial Point Pattern Analysis

    -   Network Constrained Kernel Density Map

    -   Network Constrained G/K Statistical Functions

For each of the analyses, the application will provide users with kernel density maps and perform types of hypothesis testing to allow users to generate insights towards statistical conclusions on the distribution of spatial points along networks.

Some of the use cases could incldue
