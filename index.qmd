## About the Project

The Spatial Bros is created to assist non-technical savvy users in performing geographical point pattern analysis. Our application will assist users with 2 kinds of analysis as shown:

Spatial Points Analysis

-   Network Constraint Spatial Point

-   1st/2nd Order Spatial Point Pattern Analysis

For each of the analyses, the application will provide users with kernel density maps, Geographical Accessibility maps and perform types of hypothesis testing to allow users to generate insights towards statistical conclusions on the distribution of spatial points along networks.
